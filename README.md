## Fibonacci Calculator

This is a fibonacci calculator inspired by The Odin Project [fundamentals part 4](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-4) exercise 10.

It takes a number (n) and outputs the first (n) fibonacci numbers in the sequence.

This project gave me the opportunity to practice loops, recursion, and DOM manipulation.

>In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
